# SecGD
This repository is an introductory latex section in portuguese about Euclidean Distance Geometry.


## TO DO

### Text

1. [X] Write an introductory section on the great minds behind this theory
2. [X] Write a little definition of metric spaces as appendix  section
3. [X] Write an presentation about the fundamental problem in DG and define it
4. [X] Write a brief list with some classical applications in the GD
5. [X] Define the WSNL (wireless sensor networks localization)
6. [X] Write about realization of complete graphs 
7. [X] Write a subsection about the solution of the linear system in trilateration topics
8. [X] Write on the solution set of a DGP (Intersection of spheres --- geometric interpretation --- and number of solutions)
9. [ ] Write a subsubsection about the unique realization (global rigity) in WSNL (see section 4.1.1 in the Leo's SIAM paper)?
10. [ ] Rewrite the appendix B using only distances (?)
11. [ ] Write about realization of (K+1)-cliques in R^K? (not only is a unique solution possible, but it analyzes the necessary uniqueness criteria --- zero k-simplex volume and flat simplices)
12. [ ] Write about Trilateration Orders, Trilaterative DGP? (important in WSNL application. For example, if a graph has a K-trilateration order, then it is globally rigid)
