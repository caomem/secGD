# SecGD
This repository is an introductory latex section in portuguese about Euclidean Distance Geometry.


## TO DO

1. [X] Write an introductory section on the great minds behind this theory
2. [X] Write an apresentation about the fundamental problem in DG and define it
3. [X] Write a little definition of metric spaces as apendice section
4. [X] Write a brief list of the classical applications of DG
5. [ ] Write about taxonomy of problems in DG and aplications
6. [ ] Write on the solution set of a DGP (remember of mencion about the infinit solutions for rigid moves)
7. [X] Define the WSNL (wireless sensor networks localization) and cite the MDGP as possible aplication in WSNL 
8. [ ] Introduce the DVOP and define the DDGP, DDGPk and DMDGPk
